Project ObjectiveÂ 
This Credit Risk Assessment agent is a Python-based application that leverages advanced machine learning techniques, including Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning and Reinforcement Learning (RL), to evaluate credit risk. The project aims to provide more transparent, effective, and explainable solutions to the complex task of assessing creditworthiness.
Features
Multiple Assessment Models: Implements base, Chain of Thought, and Reinforcement Learning-enhanced credit risk assessment models.
Explainable AI: Utilizes Chain of Thought reasoning to provide step-by-step explanations for credit decisions.
Adaptive Learning: Incorporates Reinforcement Learning to improve decision-making over time.
Comprehensive Risk Evaluation: Considers various factors including personal information, financial status, loan details, and credit history.
Performance Metrics: Includes accuracy scoring and detailed classification reports for model evaluation.

Requirements
Python 3.7+
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib (for visualization, if needed)

Methodology
This project implements three main approaches to credit risk assessment:
Base Model (CreditRiskAgent): A standard machine learning approach using Random Forest Classifier.
Chain of Thought Model (CoTCreditRiskAgent): Enhances the base model with a step-by-step reasoning process, providing explanations for its decisions.
Reinforcement Learning Model (RLCoTCreditRiskAgent): Combines the Chain of Thought approach with Reinforcement Learning, allowing the model to adapt and improve its decision-making over time.

Each model considers various aspects of a loan application, including:
Personal information (age, employment length)
Financial status (income, home ownership)
Loan details (amount, purpose, interest rate)
Credit history (defaults, credit history length)
